* Author: Alex Lewtschuk
* Class: CS354 

## Overview

This is an interpreter that was built for my programming languages course.

## Compiling and Using

To run the code please use terminal and run the test class in the IDE of your choice or run the Interpreter.java file using the command `java Interpreter.java` after compiling. 

You can type the program into the Interpreter if you want to assess using that.
